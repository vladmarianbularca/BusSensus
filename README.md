# BusSensus- Team project REAL Life Website

Landingpage for bus counter app. This is a team project from Digital Nation explorers where we developed a landingpage for our local bus company.We were divided in 6 teams and our team won. Our team was formed with: 1 Project Manager, 2 Web designers, 2 Web developers and two members from a local IT company as mentors. My role during the project was to give ideas for design and functionalities, and develop the website. Togheter with my colleague we developed after the design was recived. My developmenet part was to make a side Navbar and first page. After our work was done we recived a much needed help, from our Digital Nation mentor to unite our worked parts and import everything in a custom WordPress theme.
When the site was imported my colleague and I had to make some changes according to our client needs.
